# Coin Flipper Application

This project features a simple React application that simulates a coin flip, displays the result (Heads/Tails), and keeps track of the counts for each side.

## Project Description

The application allows users to flip a coin with a click of a button. During the flip, a visual animation of the coin spinning is displayed. After a short delay, the final result (Heads or Tails) is revealed, and the respective counters are updated.

## Features

* **Dynamic Coin Flip:** Click the "Flip the coin" button to initiate a flip.
* **Visual Animation:** The coin animates by rapidly switching between Heads and Tails images during the flip duration.
* **Final Result Display:** Shows the outcome of the last flip (Heads or Tails).
* **Flip Counters:** Keeps a running tally of the total Heads and Tails.
* **Flipping State Management:** The button is disabled while the coin is flipping to prevent multiple simultaneous flips.
* **Basic and Clear User Interface.**
* **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes (mobile friendly).

## Technologies Used

* [cite_start][React](https://react.dev/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [cite_start][TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
